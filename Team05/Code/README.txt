Code05 Folder contains our Visual Studio solution (source files).
Tests05 Folder contains our test files (including unit testing, complete system testing test files)
Team05.pdf is the Final Report for this project

--------------- SOURCE ------------------

The source files are located inside each module's folder.

For example the source files for DesignExtractor will be in "..\Team05\Code05\DesignExtractor\"
together with the solution files (.vcxproj) for each of the module.

-----------------------------------------



---------------- AUTOTESTER --------------------

Open "Static-Code-Analyzer.sln" in Visual C++ Express 2010 (this is the version we use)
Set the build box on top to be in "Release" mode, not "Debug".

We have set the dependencies such that building AutoTester directly is possible.
However if it somehow unable to build,
Please build in the following order:
- PKB
- CodeParser
- DesignExtractor
- QueryProcessor
- AutoTester

After building the AutoTester, please navigate to the Release folder. The AutoTester.exe will be inside.
i.e. "..\Team05\Code05\Release\AutoTester.exe"
and find AutoTester.exe in the directory

Please move the AutoTester.exe to the desired directory with the source file and test cases.
Then launch command prompt in the directory and run AutoTester as defined in the AutoTester guide.
i.e. AutoTester.exe source1.txt query1.txt result1.xml

------------------------------------------------




------------------ UNIT TESTING ----------------------

We apologize that we are unable to place all the Unit testing below in one directory, i.e. "UnitTesting",
because Visual C++ 2010 Express does not allow creating a directory for multiple vcxproj.

If we place the testing in the "UnitTesting" directory, they will not be able to be built.

Hence we have renamed the unit testing folders and related files, with the "Test" prefix.


To run unit tests (CPPUNIT), build and run any of the following in Visual C++ express 2010:
- TestCalls
- TestCodeParser
- TestDesignExtractor
- TestFollows
- TestModifies
- TestNext
- TestParent
- TestPKB
- TestQueryEvaluator
- TestQueryParser
- TestSibling
- TestTable
- TestUses

After building any unit test, please navigate to the Release folder
i.e. "..\Team05\Code05\Release\"
and find the unitTestName.exe, e.g. TestQueryParser.exe

If you are RUNNING CodeParser, or Design Extractor Unit Test.
- Please copy the TestCodeParser.exe to the Test Folder, CodeParser Unit Test case.
  i.e. "Team05\Tests05\CodeParser Unit Test Cases"
  then double click / run the TestCodeParser.exe in that directory
- Please copy the TestDesignExtractor.exe to the Test Folder, DesignExtractor Unit Test case.
  i.e. "Team05\Tests05\DesignExtractor Unit Test Cases"
  then double click / run the TestDesignExtractor.exe in that directory

If you are RUNNING other unit testing:
- Double click / run the respective executable unit test in any directory, i.e. in the Release folder itself

We have been using AutoTester as integration testing as well
due to the convenience and easy to debug with std out.
